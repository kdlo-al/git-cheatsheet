------git cheatsheet------
git init: create a new git repository
git status: inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add: add files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff: shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area 
git commit: permanently stores files changes from the staging area in the repository
git log: shows a list of all the previous commits

----git teamwork workflow----
git clone: create a local copy of a remote
git remote -v: list a git project's remotes
git fetch: fetches work from the remote into the local copy
git merge origin/master: merges origin/master into your local branch
git push origin <branch_name>: pushes a local branch to the origin remote

----git branch workflow----
git branch: lists all a git's project branches
git branch branch_name: creates a new branch
git checkout branch_name: used to switch from one branch to another
git merge branc_name: used to join file changes from one branch to another
git branch -d branch_name: deletes the branch specified 

----git backlogging in git----
git checkout HEAD filename: discards changes in the working directory
git reset HEAD filename: unstages file changes in the staging area
git reset commit_SHA: reset to a previous commit in your commit history

*additionally you learned a way to add multiple files to the staging area with a single command:
git add filename_1 filename_2*
